Program 1:
A student must answer a minimum of 3 questions. However a student can also answer more than 3 questions. In such a scenario the best three answers are
taken to compute the total score. A question paper can have a maximum of 5 questionsand each question carries 15 marks. Simulate the behaviour in a C++ program
that uses the concept of functions with variable number of arguments.


Program 3:
Write a Program in which there's a class Publication which has title and price as input variables. There are also appropriate methods to set and get. There's another class Sales
with number of copies printed and sold with appropriate methods to set and get . The last class is a Book class which will contain as member objects of the above two
classes (Object composition), and a data member variable no_of_pages. Use constructor to initialize variables to default (or suitable) values and use the objects of
the included classes to call the constructors explicitly (according to the principles of object composition and delegation). Print all the data from within the book class.


program 2:
Repeat The Above Program Using Inheritance.
